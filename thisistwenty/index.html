      <section id="summary">
        <p>At age 19, I spent my first summer in NYC, feeling overwhelmed and lost. I had secured the opportunity of my wildest dreams, but something was missing. It didn’t take long to realize what my experience was lacking: a female mentor. </p>
        <p>I began to avidly research and follow female-founded companies and their leaders, who support each other professionally and personally. These women form a strong, interconnected web of support, which makes it possible for them to not only achieve their aspirations but also for their female peers to be lifted up. Via Instagram, I watched as these women interacted, both online and at IRL meetups, as they unknowingly restored my faith in a world that at times felt utterly defeating. </p>
        <p>One day, alone in my 5th-floor East Village walk-up, I typed in my notes a list of all of the ambitious, resilient, determined, confident and compassionate women who inspired me. The list contained names spanning across the globe, across all industries, and all stages of success. In the weeks following, I found myself revisiting this list to expand it. This list, which held the names of empowered women who instilled confidence within me, would become the genesis for the mission on which I’d embark upon returning for my sophomore year at University of Miami in the fall.  </p>
        <p>After years of dismissal and feeling undervalued, which I began to accept as the norm, I was pleasantly surprised by the warm, encouraging responses I received from the women whom I admired; they were so eager to share their advice and experiences. I knew that these conversations we were having were valuable, not just to me, but to others as well. I had to put it all somewhere. </p>
        <p>As my 20th birthday loomed closer, I became increasingly panicked over the weight this upcoming decade seemingly carries. In order to gain insight about this turbulent time, which has been lauded by the media as the most formative decade of one’s life, I decided to ask the women who inspire me three simple questions:</p>
        <p>1. Who were you at twenty?</p>
        <p>2. How have you evolved since?</p>
        <p>3. What advice would you give yourself at twenty?</p>
        <p>My hope is that this collective will shine a bright light on women whose success is twofold. Not only do these women strive to achieve their dreams, but they also understand the importance of celebrating and supporting the dreams of others. Ultimately, my goal is to cultivate a community in which we can all celebrate ourselves and each other, reflecting on our pasts while looking towards our futures. </p>
        <p>Welcome to This is Twenty. </p>

        <p class="story">It was on my way to the airport to travel to London for the semester that I stumbled upon Liz Stone’s work, via a feature on the HER Europe instagram page, and I’m so glad I did.

Twenty-eight year old Liz Stone is a poised and witty London based digital marketing wizz. At twenty-four Stone left her job in fashion to freelance, following her passion for content curation and creative marketing. As clients began to line up, Stone saw a need for better and more effective digital marketing strategies, and in 2015 Co-founded OK COOL, a creative agency.

This year, Liz Stone Co-founded Ok Mentor alongside Stef Stanely, Senior Account Director at LinkedIn. The duo launched the program out of their desire to give back to young female creatives in London, emparting on them the wisdom and skills they wish they had known in their early twenties. The program just wrapped up its first series (I wish it didn’t have to end, like ever), but luckily for everyone stateside, they have future plans to expand Ok Mentor and take it global!</p>
        <h5>Who were you at twenty? </h5>
        <p class="story">I was a loud, excited and ambitious final year student at Fedisa Fashion School in Cape Town, South Africa. I was petrified of boredom and overfilled my time with projects and activities. I was never academic and struggled with subjects like maths and English but I was a hard worker, often working till 2-3am on my projects, but always felt incredibly proud of my work.</p>
        <h6>On working in fashion & discovering her true passion</h6>
        <p class="story">I started working for a fashion designer as his Personal Assistant. I quickly worked my way up to helping him run the entire business. I worked on everything from financial, accounting, supply chain management, inventory, e-commerce management, marketing, and sales. I learned how to do a lot of very different things in the space of two years and through that, I figured out what I enjoyed doing most - creative marketing and content creation - I took that knowledge, quit my job and started my company.</p>
        <h5>HOW HAVE YOU EVOLVED SINCE?</h5>
        <p class="story">I’m still hard-working but have learned to delegate smaller tasks to other people, freeing up my time to work on things that will have an exponential effect on my success. </p>
        <h6>ON FOUNDING OK COOL</h6>
        <p class="story">It was a very exciting/daunting few months as I was setting up the business. Luckily I had a close friend who was an experienced agency founder— he helped me in the initial phase with branding, positioning and business structure, (he later came on and joined me as a full-time business partner and co-founder). I really had no idea what I was doing so I leaned on friends, advisors and the internet to answer my questions. The business grew organically and we didn’t take any money from investors to set it up, the only way this was possible was because at the time, the service we were offering (good quality social media content at a reasonable price) was in high demand. It was this spike in demand that made me realise we were doing the right thing. </p>
        <h6>ON DIFFERENTIATING OK COOL THROUGH GOOD MORALS AND VALUES</h6>
        <p class="story">Truth be told, we are not that different from other branding agencies. We just make better work that’s more innovative, culturally relevant, and cool. People want to work with us because we’re kind, warm people who put humans first. We care about the success of each client and treat them like our own. </p>
        <h6>ON FOUNDING OK MENTOR & THE PROGRAM’S MISSION</h6>
        <p class="story">Ok Mentor is a free IRL mentorship scheme set up to provide real-world commercial training to young female graduates looking to break into creative industries. The course teaches everything from developing a stand-out CV and portfolio, ensuring profitability and managing taxes, all the way through to writing a good email. The 12-hour intensive program (spread across 2 weeks) includes four sessions that cover fundamental business training. An exciting line up of mentors have signed on, ready to pass on their knowledge. Some of them include Amanda Morgan, Managing Director at Byredo and Diptyque (UK&I), Whitney Rosenthal, Head of Emerging Talent at Instagram, Naomi Walkland, Senior Marketing Manager at Bumble EMEA, and Katie Hunter, Social & Influencer Lead at Karmarama.

My partner in this mission, Stef Stanley and I both felt there is a shortage of resources available to young graduates and young professionals who want to succeed in a creative field. There are no shortcuts to gaining experience and nurturing your own talent, but there are a lot of fundamentals that aren’t really taught at University.</p>
        <h5>WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE YOURSELF AT TWENTY?</h5>
        <p class="story">I would tell myself 2 things: </p>
        <p class="story">1. Don’t get too caught up with trying to achieve everything right now. Be patient, have a plan and trust the process. Things will work themselves out.</p>
        <p class="story">2. Start saving! You never know when you might need some capital</p>
        <h5>WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO A TWENTY-SOMETHING YEAR OLD ABOUT FINDING HER PLACE IN THE WORLD?</h5>
        <p class="story">1. Make sure that whatever you choose to do is at the intersection of what you love (your passion), what the world needs (your mission), what you are good at (your vocation), and what you can get paid for (your profession). By achieving these four elements you will lead a fulfilled life.
</p>
         <p class="story">2. Set yourself a career goal. A dream for the future. It can be wildly ambitious. Visualise your dream with as much clarity as possible. Visualise what you’re wearing, who you’re with, where you are, the work you’re doing, the money you’re making, even the color of the walls. Keep this picture in your mind every day until you start to get closer to it. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="interview2">
        <p class="story">Today, twenty-nine year old Sinead Bovell is confident, poised, and knows exactly who she is and what she wants. However, that wasn’t always the case. After years of building her perfect resume with top internships and receiving her MBA, Bovell began what she thought would be her dream career in consulting, yet found herself terrified and unhappy, realizing not once had she stopped to ask herself, ‘Am I actually passionate about this?’.

At twenty-four Bovell took a gamble, leaving her consulting career in Toronto, Canada and the only life she had ever known to take an unconventional path, defining success on her own terms. She relocated to New York City to build her modeling career and company, Weekly Advice for Young Entrepreneurs (WAYE), in an effort to make “the future of technology cool, digestible, and relevant to all demographics.”

Known as ‘The model who talks tech’, Sinead Bovell is carving her own path, using her experiences and platform to prepare young entrepreneurs for the digital future, equipping them with the foundation and tools to build something sustainable.</p>
        <h6>ON FOUNDING WAYE</h6>
        <p class="story">People always say that Millenials and Gen Z are ‘tech savvy’ and yes the average person under thirty-five can make something go viral on Youtube or Instagram, but they couldn’t tell you how blockchain is going to change their job and that’s a problem because advanced technologies are going to impact every single one of us. And when you look at who’s talking tech, it’s coming from people that most of us can’t relate to. It’s almost like this ‘bubble’ in Silicon Valley that’s writing the rules of the future and we’re all very separate from it, but fundamentally dependent on what they are producing.

What we do at WAYE is change the narrative of who’s talking tech and who should be listening. You don’t have to necessarily have to have a PHD or work in Silicon Valley to be in the room. And in fact, the people that don’t have that stereotype or aren’t in that demographic should be in the room because we’re likely the ones that are going to be impacted the most by automation and the future of those technologies in our lives.</p>
        <h5>WHO WERE YOU AT TWENTY?</h5>
        <p class="story">At twenty, I was incredibly focused and ambitious, studying both finance and chemistry at university, with 100% certainty I would go on to get an MBA and work in a corporate job that my peers would deem as successful. All of those things came true, but what was missing was any sense of what success meant to me. I was chasing other people’s versions of success. I had never defined it for myself.</p>
        <h6>ON REALIZING HER LIFELONG DREAM WAS NOT ‘HER DREAM’</h6>
        <p class="story">At twenty-four I hit an absolute ultimatum - I was gearing up to start as a management consultant, anxious and unhappy, when an opportunity to model presented itself. What I was quitting and giving up to go do wasn’t really something that anyone had done. To go to business school and be this really corporate person and then say, ‘I’m actually going to quit and become a fashion model and move to New York to start over and build a company from that’- there was nobody I could bounce that idea off of to be like ‘oh yeah well when I did that…’.</p>
        <h5>HOW HAVE YOU EVOLVED SINCE?</h5>
        <p class="story">Since then, I have realized that it doesn’t matter how high up you are in a lane that you are not passionate about, because it will never make you happy. I look inward when it comes to measures of success and life goals, and I focus on the 10 year vision of who I want to be, versus what I “want to do.”</p>
        <h6>ON AN UNLIKELY MODELING CAREER </h6>
        <p class="story">When I was having all that doubt and anxiety about consulting and thinking, ‘What have I done, how have I gotten this far on this path that I don’t actually want to be on?’, once the opportunity presented itself, modeling became a strategic choice. I would have never considered it in a million years, but it seemed too much of a miracle to pass up.</p>
        <h6>ON USING HER MODELING PLATFORM TO BUILD WAYE</h6>
        <p class="story">My modeling career has really helped to amplify my message about technology and has also been integral in the brand of WAYE. We’re preaching a change in the narrative of who’s talking tech and being a mixed race model that can also tell you about code and the future of blockchain is the core identity of what our brand is. We don’t all have to look a certain way and have the same resume, we can wear sneakers and still be heard and I think that’s why a lot of young people gravitate towards WAYE. We’re saying, ‘Don’t change your identity, don’t feel like you have to be nerdier, be you and you can still have these really important conversations.’</p>
        <h6>ON ADOPTING THE ‘NEW YORK HUSTLE’ AND SPEAKING AT THE UNITED NATIONS</h6>
        <p class="story">The opportunity to speak at the UN was actually kind of a New York hustle at it’s finest. When I had just started WAYE, I had also just moved to New York, become a model, all of these things were new all at once and I didn’t really have a business network or mentors here. So I started to reach out to females in business that I admired. I would literally google ‘Female entrepreneurs in NYC’ and then find them on LinkedIn and reach out and say, ‘I’m new to the entrepreneurial world, I really admire your work and I would love to meet for coffee.’ And that’s how I tried to build my network.

One of the women I reached out to was hosting a breakfast for founders and invited me to come. I started talking to a gentleman there and through a series of meetings I ended up in front of a group of people from the UN. I used the opportunity to pitch what WAYE was about and why the UN needs to take seriously the future of automation and our lack of preparation for it. They really heard the message and invited me to speak, which when it actually happened, was a very surreal and empowering experience.</p>


        <h5>WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE YOURSELF AT TWENTY?</h5>
        <p class="story">People always say don’t settle in relationships, but why would you treat your career any differently? Why would you treat your life any differently? It doesn’t matter how high up you are in a lane that you aren’t passionate about, if it's just a "job," you will never feel satisfied. Your dream career should be an extension of your life and who you are.</p>
        <h6>ON THE IMPORTANCE OF LOVING YOUR WORK</h6>
        <p class="story">It’s ingrained in our culture that work is work and I realize that for some people that actually is motivating. I have friends who like doing what they do from 9 to 5 and they just live for everything after 5PM. For me, I couldn’t accept that reality; of dreading Sunday nights knowing that on Monday, I couldn’t wait until the clock struck 5. If you don’t feel inspired and you live for 5 pm, don’t let that be the end destination or don’t keep building towards that life. Just take what you need from that- the experience, the resume, the connections, whatever it is and be directional of where that’s going to take you. </p>
        <h6>ON BUILDING YOUR ‘TOOLKIT’, FIRST, AND TRUSTING YOUR GUT, SECOND</h6>
        <p class="story">Don’t bet on your internship being the thing you do for the rest of your life. We’re always told to think about our career as, ‘What do you want to do when you grow up?’ Who really knows… there’s not one job that’s perfect for anybody. What you need to think about is ‘Who do you want to be? What impact do you want to make?’ and then think about the tools you need to get there.

I’m a firm believer that if you build the tool kit and do the work and build the foundation, you owe it to yourself to then go and pursue the thing that you think is going to make you happy, but know that your dream job is something you’ll usually have to create yourself. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="interview3">
        <p class="story">From a young age, Dr. Lauren Hazzouri had ingrained in her own mind that she would never be good enough. When her dream of becoming a professional dancer was cut short in college and her own mental health issues arose, she was redirected to her true purpose, psychology.

Today, forty-four year-old Dr. Lauren Hazzouri, is the founder of Hazzouri Psychology, has written for multiple online publications, and spoken at events across the country (including my personal favorite, Sophia Amoruso’s Girlboss Rallies).  Hazzouri has made it her life's mission to empower girls and women to overcome those same self-esteem issues she once faced and is equipping them with the tools to stand in their power, all through what she calls, “Not Therapy with Dr. Lauren.” Combining her lifelong love for dance and career in psychology, Dr. Lauren is teaching us all that when it comes time to make your life matter, there are no skills that are wasted.</p>
        <h6>ON HER CHILDHOOD AND THE DESIRE TO FEEL LIKE ENOUGH</h6>
        <p class="story">When I was little I was hypersensitive to my environment and felt things very deeply. From the time I was in kindergarten, I recognized the things that were valued by others and the things that weren’t.  I tried to morph into what I thought people wanted me to be; I wanted people to like me, we all do. I remember having to read aloud in elementary school. I always counted the number of seats in front of me and the number of paragraphs before my turn to read aloud, so that I could pre-read my paragraph. I didn’t want to sound stupid. The ongoing perceived theme throughout my childhood was, “Lauren, you can’t do anything right”.

My mom enrolled me in ballet classes. Dance was a game-changer. Finally, there was something I could do right! By the time I was in fourth grade, I rushed from school to the dance studio every chance I got. I played the good girl role in school all day; I did everything I was supposed to do, but when I got to the dance studio, I unleashed all of me and left it all on the dance floor. I put a lot of time, energy, and effort into my dance training and assumed I was destined to become a professional dancer. That dream didn’t come to fruition, but I always felt my value and my spirit awaken, when I danced. </p>
        <h5>WHO WERE YOU AT TWENTY?</h5>
        <p class="story">At twenty, I was a junior in college. I originally went to a school on the west coast on a dance scholarship, but it was too far from home for me. So, I went to an audition at NYU in hopes of transferring closer to home. I got cut before I even performed my solo. Up until that point I’d thought I was good enough to “make it” professionally. My immediate thought was, “If I got cut from NYU then I’m not good enough to be a professional dancer. What am I even doing?” It felt embarrassing and cued my own mental health concerns: anxiety, depression, an eating disorder. I lost 25 pounds in a couple of months and was having panic attacks everyday. I could no longer dance—physically or emotionally. I transferred schools and changed my major to psychology.

Once I had the courage to identify the problems I’d been struggling with for some time, I was desperate for solutions. I began reading, researching and implementing a number of potential life-saving techniques and made a commitment to figuring it out. </p>
        <h5>HOW HAVE YOU EVOLVED SINCE?</h5>
        <p class="story">Since then, I’ve learned how to live. I focused hardcore in school. Eventually, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology, earned my master’s degree and later, my doctoral degree in psychology, and then opened my own private practice. Along the way, I took my mental health into my own hands, experimenting with lifestyle and cognitive techniques—moving two steps forward, one step back until I had honed a simple emotionally and physically supportive lifestyle system that transformed me into the woman I am today. I am confident; I recognize my value; I manage my mood, anxieties and life stressors with balance and grace. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flawed. None of us is perfect, but I’m proud to be me and like myself, a lot. </p>
        <h6>ON BECOMING THE ONLY ‘DANCING PSYCHOLOGIST’</h6>
        <p class="story">When I started my private practice in Pennsylvania, I thought ‘this is easy, this is safe, I don’t have to wear a leotard. I’ll just go to work, make my own hours’. I was kinda right. My life was pretty easy in all the ways that I needed my life to be easy at the time. It felt stable, safe and doable.

There was only one thing missing from that life—me. I mean, I was doing exactly what I was trained to do, yet somehow I’d lost my true essence in the midst of it all. That is, until the girls and women came into my private practice. I was trained to say, “How was your week and how does that feel?”,  but when the girls and women came into my office, I never had to ask them ‘and how does that feel?’. They would say something, and I would think to myself, ‘OMG, How come these girls and women have all the same thoughts and feelings and actions as I had like 20 years ago?’. I needed to figure it out.

I researched self-esteem and read all I could about social norms and how social messaging affects our mental health. That led me to feminist psychology. I recognized much of traditional psychology doesn’t take feminism into perspective. BUT, social norms affect our mental health in such a significant way. My POV is that womens’ mental health symptoms are often secondary to the internalization of social norms.  Think about it—we all toss aside integral pieces of ourselves to fit into this place and, as a result, our spirits die.

Instinctually, I knew dance had to be part of everyone’s solution, the way it had been for me. I had to figure a way, in addition to the evidence-based strategies psychology offers, to bring these women back to life. I knew only dance could do it. I put  music on and we moved ourselves awake. Incorporating movement into the work I had been doing for years was IT. By IT, I mean my purpose. I became obsessed with bringing my solutions to a broader demographic. And, that’s what I did. I went from being a dancer to being a psychologist and now, a dancing psychologist. I became my true self in an effort to help others to become their true selves. Magic.</p>
        <h6>ON DEVELOPING #NOTTHERAPY AND WHY WE ALL NEED IT</h6>
        <p class="story">Therapy can benefit everyone, but not everyone needs therapy. We’re all exposed to social norms and they affect all of us, but that doesn’t mean that all of us require therapy. Of those who do, only about 50% get it. Regardless, everyone needs to learn about how social norms affect us. We all need to learn how to not only survive, but to thrive in this place.

I think of Not Therapy as a daily practice, a way of living. It’s like a prerequisite, whether you want to go to therapy or you don’t want to go to therapy, have the opportunity to go to therapy or not. We all need a solid, doable recipe for living. That’s what Not Therapy is, and it comes to life in many ways online and IRL. </p>
        <h6>ON THE LESSON LOOKING BACK AT HER OWN PATH </h6>
        <p class="story">I think the lesson that comes out of it all is that there’s never a day that’s lost, nothing goes to waste, there’s no skill sets that don’t come into play when it’s time for you to make your life matter. Everything does matter and everything is creating your story. You don’t know the beginning, middle, and end, none of us do. Having faith and trusting and putting one foot in front of the other will ultimately get you there. Or here, depending on how you look at it.</p>
         <h5>WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOURSELF AT TWENTY?</h5>
        <p class="story">Sit back and listen to the little voice in your head that says, “You can.” You have everything you need to get through this life in a healthy and happy way. You came knowing. </p>
        <h6>WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO A TWENTY-SOMETHING YEAR OLD ABOUT FINDING HER PLACE IN THE WORLD?
</h6>
        <p class="story">You don’t have to find your place in this world. You are here because you are necessary. Your place is not something that you need to single handedly carve out, despite what people tell you. Your duty is to shed the impact of society, rest, breathe and stand in your power. You don’t have a purpose, you are your purpose. </p>

        <p class="quote">“It was while driving up the ramp of our apartment building’s garage that Emma first pitched the brilliant idea for This is Twenty to me. Since then, Emma has created a platform that makes advice and mentorship accessible to struggling twenty something year-olds and encourages us all to trust the process. It is a space where women are recognized for their accomplishments while also offering words of wisdom to those who are still figuring it out. It is comforting to know that there are women who have overcome their own bouts of self-doubt to find careers that are both inspiring, and challenging. This is Twenty has sparked my own creativity and allowed me to have faith in my own evolution.”</p>
        <p class="person">— Sarah, twenty</p>

        <p class="quote">“This is Twenty is a platform I didn’t know I needed. In a world where hundreds of highlight reels are right in front of your face, it is incredibly humbling and empowering to hear about real women’s challenges, mindsets and invariable success. The platform has helped me to think outside of the box and serves as an important reminder to check in with myself.”</p>
        <p class="person">— Carly, twenty</p>

        <p class="quote">“This is Twenty is great. The blog curates such honest advice from really inspiring and successful women. I love reading the interviews because they really paint a picture of each woman’s journey, while still being concise and a quick read. ”</p>
        <p class="person">— Caroline, twenty-two</p>

        <p class="quote">“This is Twenty reminded me that living in the moment is important, and that I should define what success means to me. I have realized my twenties are a time to figure out who I am, what I like, and what I don’t like. I love reading stories from these inspiring women.”</p>
        <p class="person">— Maria, twenty-four</p>

        <p class="quote">“This is Twenty has become an incredible platform for women’s empowerment, motivation, and insight. Since referencing this amazing site, I’ve learned to enjoy navigating my twenties and to be confident while doing it! ”

        <p class="quote">“These days, young adults are expected to have it all figured out very early on. It is refreshing to hear from so many accomplished women who didn’t know exactly what they wanted at twenty, and how they followed their varying and unconventional paths to success; No matter your background or obstacles, keep in mind that you aren’t supposed to know and it’s okay to figure it out along the way. Enjoy the journey.”</p>
