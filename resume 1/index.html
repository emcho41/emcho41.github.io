      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><b>Junior at the University of Miami</b></p>
      <p>I am excited by brands that push the limits of what is 'conventional' whether that's in fashion, wellness, hospitality, or tech. I have an uncontainable passion for content curation, design, consumer behavior, driving social impact, and the possibility of visiting the moon (just to name a few). I thrive in collaborative settings and am an organized and fast learner.
I have greatly enjoyed my past experiences that have allowed me to explore and find strategic ways to bring the visual medium to business ventures, creating positive experiences for both consumers and a brand; I am currently seeking internship roles for Summer 2020 in marketing, sales, strategic partnerships, or a combination of all three!</p>
